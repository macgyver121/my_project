# Basic commands in SQL
use the DB browser (SQLite)
## Create / Insert 
Create table and insert data to table
```
-- create example tables
CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INT,
    name TEXT,
    level TEXT,
    manager_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

INSERT INTO employee VALUES 
	(1, 'David', 'CEO', NULL),
    (2, 'John', 'SVP', 1),
    (3, 'Mary', 'VP', 2),
    (4, 'Adam', 'VP', 2),
    (5, 'Scott', 'Manager', 3),
    (6, 'Louise', 'Manager', 3),
    (7, 'Kevin', 'Manager', 4),
    (8, 'Takeshi', 'Manager', 4),
    (9, 'Joe', 'AM', 6),
    (10, 'Anna', 'AM', 7);

SELECT * FROM employee;
```

UPDATE employee
SET name == 'Johnathan'
WHERE id == 1 ;

select * from employee; 
```
## Add column
```
ALTER TABLE employee ADD address ; 
```
## Delete table

```
# Query commands for SQL

**use chinook.db for the database**

## Select
```
-- select columns from table
SELECT
	firstname,
	lastname,
	country
FROM customers;
```

## Transform column
Create the new column by the existing column
```
-- create/ transform columns
SELECT
	firstname,
	lastname,
	firstname || ' ' || lastname AS fullname,
	LOWER(firstname) || '@company.com' AS email
FROM customers;
```

## Case when
Create the new column with the condition from existing column
```
-- CASE is like IF-ELSE in Google Sheets
SELECT 
	company,
	CASE
		WHEN company IS NOT NULL THEN 'Corporate'
		ELSE 'End Customer'
	END AS segment
FROM customers;
```

## STRFTIME
Create the new columns that show day, month, and year in each column from the datetime column and filter to show only row that have YEAR = 2010
```
-- STRFTIME
SELECT  
    invoicedate, 
    CAST(STRFTIME('%Y', invoicedate) AS INT) AS YEAR, 
	STRFTIME('%m', invoicedate) AS month,
	STRFTIME('%d', invoicedate) AS day,
	STRFTIME('%Y-%m', invoicedate) AS monthid
from invoices 
WHERE YEAR = 2010 ;
```

## Join 3 tables and Filter
Join the artists, albums and tracks table with artist id and album id then filter for only the name is Aerosmith
```
-- Example Join in the video
SELECT
	art.artistid,
	art.name,
	alb.title,
	tra.name,
	tra.composer
FROM artists AS art
JOIN albums  AS alb 
	ON art.artistid = alb.artistid 
JOIN tracks  AS tra
  	ON tra.albumid = alb.albumid
-- WHERE is used after JOINs completed
WHERE art.name = 'Aerosmith';
```

## Filter (with AND, OR, NOT)
Filter data from country column
```
-- filter data that country is USA
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE country = 'USA';

-- filter data that country is USA and state is CA
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE country = 'USA' AND state = 'CA';

-- filter data that country is USA or Canada

## Filter matching (with LIKE)
**%** matches any number of characters (0 or more)

**_** matches single character

**LIKE** case sensitive matches

```
-- filter email column that contains @gmail.com at rear
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com'

## Coalesce 
Use coalesce to replace NULL value with desired value
```
-- replace NULL value with 'End Customer'
SELECT 
  company,
  COALESCE(company, 'End Customer') AS cleanCompany
FROM customers;
```
alternative method - can use case when to replace NULL with desired value
```
SELECT 
  CustomerId, 
  company,
  CASE WHEN company IS NULL THEN 'End Customer'
       ELSE 'Corporate'
  END AS segment
FROM customers;
```

## Join tables (with WHERE)
Join two tables with WHERE and filter artistid is 8, 100, 120
```
SELECT
  artists.artistid,
  artists.name AS artist_name,
  albums.title AS album_name
FROM artists, albums
WHERE artists.artistid = albums.artistid -- PK = FK
  AND artists.artistid IN (8, 100, 120);
```

Join three tables with WHERE and filter artistid is 8, 100, 120

## Aggregate Functions
Find average, summary, minimun, maximum, count of miliseconds columns from tracks table

Use round to prescribe 2 decimal numbers
```
SELECT
  ROUND(AVG(milliseconds), 2) AS avg_mill,
  SUM(milliseconds)           AS sum_mill,
  MIN(milliseconds)           AS min_mill,

Filter data after use group by
```
-- Filter only genre that have number of tracks more than 100 and genre is not Rock 
SELECT 
    genres.name, 
    COUNT(*) AS count_songs 
FROM genres, tracks 
WHERE genres.genreid = tracks.genreid AND genres.name <> 'Rock'
GROUP BY genres.name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 100 ;
```

from genres join tracks
on genres.genreid = tracks.genreid ;

-- join table (where)
SELECT *
from genres, tracks
WHERE genres.genreid = tracks.genreid ;
```

## Select Data From Multiple Tables with alias and LIKE
Join table with where and LIKE to filter data
```
-- using alias to join table and LIKE
SELECT 
	A.ArtistId,
	A.name,
	B.Title
FROM artists A, albums B
WHERE A.artistid = B.artistid
AND A.name LIKE 'C%' ;
```

## Join tale with Count
** Join or Inner join is default join for SQL "most popular join in Data analyst" but right join and full outer join does not have in SQLite
Join table with inner join and count Aerosmith's song
```
-- find Aerosmith, note that AS is optional clause
SELECT 
		A.artistid,
		A.Name  AS artistName,
		B.Title AS albumName,
		C.Name  AS trackName
FROM artists A
INNER JOIN albums B ON A.ArtistId = B.ArtistId
INNER JOIN tracks C ON B.AlbumId = C.AlbumId
WHERE A.Name = 'Aerosmith';
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85028821/211560712-869feb30-0220-421e-9fd1-658a28d90e34.png)

```
SELECT 
	count(*) Aerosmith_Songs
FROM artists A
INNER JOIN albums B ON A.ArtistId = B.ArtistId
INNER JOIN tracks C ON B.AlbumId = C.AlbumId
WHERE A.Name = 'Aerosmith';
```
Group by country with count distinct customers, transaction and sum revenue
```
-- a little advanced query, try to read and interpret the result
SELECT 
    customers.country, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT customers.customerid) AS n_customers,
    COUNT(invoices.total) AS n_transactions,
    SUM(invoices.total)   AS total_revenue
FROM customers  
JOIN invoices 
ON customers.customerid = invoices.customerid 
GROUP BY 1 
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

## Left Join vs. Inner Join
Create new Table (book_shop and favourite book)
```
-- create two tables
CREATE TABLE book_shop (
	id INT,
  name TEXT,
  release_year INT
);
  
CREATE TABLE favourite_book (
  id INT, 
  author TEXT,
  reviews REAL
);

INSERT INTO book_shop VALUES
  (1, 'Think Like A Freak', 2014),
  (2, 'Ultralearning', 2019),
  (3, 'Blue Ocean Strategy', 2015),
  (4, 'The Power of Habit', 2012),
  (5, 'Outliers', 2008);

INSERT INTO favourite_book VALUES
  (1, 'Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner', 1904),
  (4, 'Charles Duhigg', 12007),
  (5, 'Malcolm Gladwell', 12063);
```
```
-- inner join
SELECT * FROM book_shop A
INNER JOIN favourite_book B ON A.id = B.id; 
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85028821/211564924-802e6200-38a9-4da9-b2b4-eb3d09b4ebd3.png)

```
-- left join
SELECT * FROM book_shop A
LEFT JOIN favourite_book B ON A.id = B.id;
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85028821/211565054-c8fb3607-260d-466a-a13c-727256a37179.png)

## Cross Join
Create new tables (ranks and suits)
```
-- create two tables: ranks and suits
-- reference: https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-cross-join/
CREATE TABLE ranks (
    rank TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE suits (
    suit TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO ranks(rank) 
VALUES('2'),('3'),('4'),('5'),('6'),('7'),('8'),('9'),('10'),('J'),('Q'),('K'),('A');

INSERT INTO suits(suit) 
VALUES('Clubs'),('Diamonds'),('Hearts'),('Spades');
```
```
-- cross join both tables to create a full card deck
SELECT * FROM ranks 
CROSS JOIN suits ORDER BY suit;
```
The answer will come out 7*5 = 35 row

## Self Join
Create new table
```
-- create a new employee table
CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INT,
    name TEXT,
    level TEXT,
    manager_id INT 
);

INSERT INTO employee VALUES 
    (1, 'David', 'CEO', NULL),
    (2, 'John', 'SVP', 1),
    (3, 'Mary', 'VP', 2),
    (4, 'Adam', 'VP', 2),
    (5, 'Scott', 'Manager', 3),
    (6, 'Louise', 'Manager', 3),
    (7, 'Kevin', 'Manager', 4),
    (8, 'Takeshi', 'Manager', 4),
    (9, 'Joe', 'AM', 6),
    (10, 'Anna', 'AM', 7);
```
Self join : the principle is to name tables differently 
```
-- self join in action and create new column
SELECT 
    t1.id, 
    t1.name AS employeeName, 
    t1.level AS employeeLevel,
    t2.name AS managerName,
    t2.level AS managerLevel,
    t1.name || ' report to ' || t2.name AS comment
FROM employee t1, employee t2
WHERE t1.manager_id = t2.id;
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85028821/211567280-46caeb78-cc9b-4e1e-b819-263392df1995.png)

## Intersect & Except
INTERSECT returns only the distinct rows contained in the two tables. Its use is similar to INNER JOIN.
```
-- intersect = which books are in both tables
SELECT id FROM book_shop
INTERSECT
SELECT id FROM favourite_book;
```
Output is ID 1,4,5

EXCEPT returns only the distinct rows in the left table that are not in the right table.
```
-- except = which books are in the left table, but not in the right tables
SELECT id FROM book_shop
EXCEPT
SELECT id FROM favourite_book;
```
Output is ID 2,3

## Union & Union All
```
-- create a new book shop table
CREATE TABLE book_shop_new (
  	id INT,
  	name TEXT,
	 	release_year INT
  );

INSERT INTO book_shop_new VALUES
  (6, 'Business Data Science', 2020),
  (7, 'Subliminal', 2018),
  (8, 'Good Strategy Bad Strategy', 2015);
```
```
-- union old and new book shop then sorted by year
SELECT * FROM book_shop
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM book_shop_new
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

## Basic Subqueries
Subqueries are a technique for writing nested queries.
```
-- basic subqueries in WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM tracks 
WHERE milliseconds = (SELECT max(milliseconds) FROM tracks);
```

```
SELECT firstname, lastname, email
FROM (
		SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA'
);
```
